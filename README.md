# Ukraine Conflict Tracker

A real-time web application that monitors and visualises potential conflict areas in Ukraine by tracking fire detections from NASA FIRMS satellite data and correlating them with explosion reports from news sources. This is my first project deployed to Azure Cloud Services.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project was developed as part of **JHUB Module 9** to demonstrate cloud deployment capabilities and API integration. The application provides:

- **Real-time satellite fire detection** data from NASA FIRMS
- **Latest news monitoring** for conflict-related reports
- **Interactive map visualisation** of fire detections across Ukraine
- **Customisable news search** with date range filtering
- **Responsive design** for all device sizes

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React.js with Vite
- **Mapping:** Leaflet & React-Leaflet
- **Styling:** Custom CSS with Ukrainian flag colour scheme
- **APIs:** 
  - NASA FIRMS (Fire Information for Resource Management System)
  - NewsAPI for real-time news data
- **Cloud Services:** Azure Static Web Apps
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for automatic deployment

## üìã Features

### Fire Detection Mapping
- Interactive map showing satellite-detected fires
- Colour-coded confidence levels (high/nominal)
- Click on markers for detailed information
- Date selection to view historical data
- Real-time fire count display

### News Integration
- Customisable keyword search
- Pre-defined search categories (Conflict, Humanitarian, Infrastructure, etc.)
- Date range filtering
- Direct links to full articles
- Relevance-based sorting

### User Interface
- Dark theme with Ukrainian blue and yellow accents
- Fully responsive design
- Loading animations
- Error handling with fallback data
- Smooth transitions and hover effects

- API keys for NASA FIRMS and NewsAPI

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShabalalaWATP/ukraine-conflict-tracker.git
cd ukraine-conflict-tracker

Install dependencies:
npm install

Create a .env file in the root directory:
VITE_NASA_FIRMS_API_KEY=your_nasa_firms_api_key
VITE_NEWS_API_KEY=your_newsapi_key

Start the development server:
npm run dev

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser

Building for Production
npm run build

üåê Azure Deployment
This application is deployed using Azure Static Web Apps with the following architecture:

Hosting: Azure Static Web Apps (Free tier)
CDN: Azure Content Delivery Network for global distribution
SSL: Automatic HTTPS certificate provisioning
CI/CD: GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment on push

Deployment Steps

Create an Azure Static Web App in the Azure Portal
Connect to GitHub repository
Configure build settings:

App location: /
API location: (leave empty)
Output location: dist


Azure automatically creates GitHub Actions workflow
Every push to main branch triggers automatic deployment
